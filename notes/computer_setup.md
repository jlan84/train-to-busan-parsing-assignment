This is all setup on the Zipfian workstations, but if you'd like to use your home computer, you can install all the same packages.

#### Step 1: Install Anaconda

We will be using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) with Python version 2.7. Install this and you will have Python along several usefull packages and programs:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Pandas
* statsmodels
* MatPlotLib
* IPython
* nose
* pep8

You can see the [full list of packages](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html) if you are so inclined.

You can use [conda](http://www.continuum.io/blog/conda) or pip to install any packages that are not included.


#### Step 2: Install Sublime

We will be using Sublime Text for editing. When you are working alone, you are welcome to use any editor you'd like. You can download [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) for free.
