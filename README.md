This is the DSI's Python Introduction.  You'll learn efficiency tips, practice 
Pythonic code, and get experience using the Python debugger and unittest modules.  

To review `git` collaboration, do the assignment as a pair.

The [assignment](assignment.md) asks you to write functions using Pythonic syntax 
and write tests for those functions using Python's unittest module.
