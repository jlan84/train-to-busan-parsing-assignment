Intro says you'll learn efficiency tips, practice Pythonic code, get experience using debugger and unittest modules.

Assignment:
1. Fill in functions 
It's about about proper data structures for the job.  Introduces the idea that "right answers"
have already been written for you, and that you'll need to fill in a test function.

Also introduces the debugger.  Also gives pdb commands.  Also introduces pycodestyle
Doesn't have them do anything with either.

2. Efficiency
Refactor poorly written code.



What it doesn't do:
Introduce directory structure
Introduce text editor/ipython/terminal work environment
Introduce jupyter notebook

Where data is coming from:

Overview of assignment:
have two files:
text_cleaning_functions.py
textparser.py

textparser.py will import functions form text_cleaning_functions.py

goal: take a text file and parse it to create two files:
a) a file that has cleaned versions of each line in it
b) another file that is simply the count of words in that line

general plan:
read in all the words - make a vocabulary (what data structure should it be)
remove stop words - how best to do that?
sort it and display it - how to do that?  
replace similar words with an identical word - how to do that?

show functions, INEMB, importing, use debugger, use unittest
